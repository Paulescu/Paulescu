It's Pau (the one with the beard 🧔🏻, the little one is my son Kai),

a curious mathematician who loves learning new things.

I enjoy solving problems.

And this whole new world is full of them.

After solving a problem, I love sharing what I learned with the people out there who feel the same.

Learn and share.

```
solution = None
while not solution:
  solution = try_to_solve(problem)
export(solution)
```

For the last 5 years, my thing has been Machine Learning.

I have started publishing a [course on Reinforcement Learning](http://datamachines.xyz/the-hands-on-reinforcement-learning-course/), so we both see if this is working for both of us.

If you guys are getting value from what I am writing now, thank you for following. It makes me very happy.

The plan is to learn and share.

Stick with me.

And get in touch.

I am always up for new ideas and problems.
